## Software Engineer

Software engineers focus more on building features for a software project rather than analysis and decision support. Some Flatiron School DS graduates have found software engineering roles that include data science elements, while others pivot to application develop roles that are more distant from the content in our curriculum.

### Software Engineer Job Description Examples

First, this is an example software engineer job description that overlaps more with data science. The official job title here is a "Junior Programmer".

> Skills and Qualifications:
> * Must have experience in socket programming or Python programming
> * Proficient in Python
> * Experience using SQL and SQL databases
> * Some understanding of financial trading industry
> * Degree in a science related field preferred â€” Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering or no degree and relevant work experience
>
> Responsibilities:
> * Develop statistical analysis tools
> * Contribute to database growth and development
> * Work as a team to develop solutions to complex problems
>
> As a Junior Programmer you will be working primarily in Python and SQL helping design and develop statistical analysis tools used by traders on the team. The ideal candidate is interested in becoming a developer in the financial industry.
>
> In this role you will be responsible for helping bring ideas to life by developing solutions that can be easily managed. Our small team environment provides a unique opportunity to take on a vast amount of responsibility and to learn quickly and on the fly.

This example software engineer job description is more of a departure from data science, but still potentially a viable option. The official job title here is a "PHP Developer".

> What will your tasks be?
>
> Your responsibilities will start with maintaining the current code, improving it, and adding new features to meet all the challenges ahead. Next to you will be a team of developers with whom you will have to work side by side to deliver value to the user of our platform in an efficient way.
>
> All PHP developers cover the backend development side. However, you'll have no problem investigating other areas (front-end, system administration) and train in them if you're interested.
>
> What are the skills you need for your day-to-day work?
> * PHP + MySQL programming in web environments
> * Code testing with PHPUnit
> * Handling PHPStorm as IDE
> * Code integration tools: Git + Gitlab
> * Good development practices: clean code and SOLID principles
> * Hexagonal architecture
> * Elastic Search
> * A good level of English for development: consulting documentation, writing simple texts, watching lectures in English, maintaining video calls in English
> * Active and constant communication with your colleagues, both in person and through remote collaboration tools
> * A good attitude and willingness to learn the skills you have not yet mastered

### Software Engineer Resources

Software engineering interviews often involve a subset of coding known as "algorithms and data structures" or "data structures and algorithms". Applicants are asked to live code a solution to a puzzle, and describe the efficiency of their solution in terms of "Big O" notation. In in-person interviews, the applicant is sometimes asked to write their code on a whiteboard, so this style of interviewing is also known as "whiteboarding".
